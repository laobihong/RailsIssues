It occurred to me that this can be used to address some of the issues relating to the use of `last` with `offset`.\r\n\r\nI have documented a number of complex issues arising from the mixing of `offset` and `last`, for example in https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/23829.\r\n\r\nThis PR is designed to address this behavior by raising an `IrreversibleOrderError` when `reverse_order` is called on an AR Relation that has an offset.\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\nThis PR involved changing the expectation for one current Rails test, from\r\n\r\n````ruby\r\nassert_equal devs[-3], Developer.offset(2).last\r\n````\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n````ruby\r\nassert_equal devs[-1], Developer.offset(2).last\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis change is in line with DHH's discussion about how `last` and `offset` should behave together in  https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/23598#issuecomment-189675440.\r\n\r\nBecause `Developer.offset(2).last` will raise an `ActiveSupport::Deprecation.warn`, I think users are reasonably well protected from this change affecting any application logic that relies on chaining these two finder methods together.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the interaction between offset and last is not fully covered in the documentation, so I am adding that as well."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24107","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24107/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24107/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24107/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/24107","id":139292450,"number":24107,"title":"ActiveRecord-4.2.6 argument out of range in 'utc' in mysql2_adapter","user":{"login":"Dariusch","id":1800181,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1800181?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dariusch","html_url":"https://github.com/Dariusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dariusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dariusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dariusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dariusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dariusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dariusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dariusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dariusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dariusch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/labels/activerecord","name":"activerecord","color":"0b02e1"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/labels/MySQL","name":"MySQL","color":"fef2c0"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-08T14:34:24Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T17:17:47Z","closed_at":null,"body":"Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI just tried to upgrade my rails-app from rails 4.2.5.2 to 4.2.6 and got a new error while running my tests.

I was able to recreate the issue in my own fork of the ActionCable examples repo.\r\n\r\nI modified the ActionCable example to mount ActionCable at the '/ws' endpoint in the routes.rb file and I also created a second channel which the client subscribes to at the same time as the first: https://github.com/rails/actioncable-examples/compare/master...eacaps:2channel-rails5-master. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpen a terminal\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/eacaps/actioncable-examples.git\r\n$ cd actioncable-examples\r\n$ git checkout 2channel-rails5-master\r\n$ ./bin/setup\r\n$ ./bin/rails server\r\nOpen http://localhost:3000/ in a browser\r\nClick on a name to log in\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you click on a name to log in the server seems to lock up. Attempting to follow the navigation will result in hung requests. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI created a separate branch that uses `5.0.0beta3` called `2channel-beta3`.

Like I show above, it also seems to work with rails `5.0.0beta3` unfortunately that release has an issue that prevents deployment on Heroku. That issue is fixed in the master branch unfortunately I ran into this separate issue. It can be temporarily remedied by creating a master channel that will subscribe to multiple separate channels but I don't think that is ideal going forward"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24093","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24093/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24093/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24093/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/24093","id":138982123,"number":24093,"title":"Eager loaded belongs_to associations are always readonly","user":{"login":"bquorning","id":22333,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22333?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquorning","html_url":"https://github.com/bquorning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquorning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquorning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquorning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquorning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquorning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquorning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquorning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquorning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquorning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/labels/activerecord","name":"activerecord","color":"0b02e1"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/labels/attached%20PR","name":"attached PR","color":"006b75"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/labels/With%20reproduction%20steps","name":"With reproduction steps","color":"009800"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-03-07T13:49:08Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T03:13:39Z","closed_at":null,"body":"### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/bquorning/0ac738564824aa8ce57b\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nEager loaded belongs_to associations should not be readonly.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nEager loaded belongs_to associations are always readonly.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: v5.0.0.beta1 and up, including latest master\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: All.\r\n\r\n### Extra\r\n\r\nIt seems the issue was introduced in #18097."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24092","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24092/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24092/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24092/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/24092","id":138970783,"number":24092,"title":"ActionCable having troubles parsing JSON","user":{"login":"nowakov","id":6850632,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6850632?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowakov","html_url":"https://github.com/nowakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/labels/actioncable","name":"actioncable","color":"bfdadc"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-03-07T12:48:28Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T15:13:39Z","closed_at":null,"body":"### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm trying to connect with ActionCable, not using JS, but with websocket-client on raspi.

If that's the case what is the best way to communicate with actioncable from external devices? I'm planning to use it with python script on raspi and iOS devices.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 5.0.0.beta3\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 2.3.0\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24088","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24088/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24088/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24088/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24088","id":138842216,"number":24088,"title":"Initialize `column.table_name` immediately for `column.serial?` correctly working","user":{"login":"kamipo","id":12642,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12642?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo","html_url":"https://github.com/kamipo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/labels/activerecord","name":"activerecord","color":"0b02e1"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-06T21:48:54Z","updated_at":"2016-03-06T22:56:53Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/pulls/24088","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24088","diff_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24088.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24088.patch"},"body":"Currently the results of `column.serial?` is not correct.

pr consist of some additions into `Configuring Rails Applications` doc.\r\n+ Added information about inserting middlewares with indexes. I think this information is useful. For example If you want to use `Rack::Cors` gem for handling preflight requests adding it on the top of the middleware stack would be good choice. The easiest way to do is providing index to `insert_before`. Also we can use indexes for `insert_after` but the behaviour is not same with `insert_before` and I think this is not the right place to give full information about all configuration options.\r\n+ The configuration for I18n fallbacks is important for production environment.

During this upgrade process Rails checks to see if the `listen` library is required. If `listen` is required `ActiveSupport::EventedFileUpdateChecker` is added to the bottom of `config/environments/development.rb` as:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.file_watcher = ActiveSupport::EventedFileUpdateChecker\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe check for the `listen` library requirement is performed on a fresh installation of a Rails 5 project which is why this is a non-issue for fresh Rails projects using beta 3. It is expected that if the `listen` library is required the `listen` and `spring-watcher-listen` gems are present in the `:development` group of the Gemfile. That same requirement check is not happening during the upgrade process for the Gemfile which produces the error raised in #24063.\r\n\r\nThis change to the `app:upgrade` task upgrades the project’s existing Gemfile to include the new development dependencies introduced by Rails 5.\r\n\r\n/cc @sadinie @maclover7 @rafaelfranca

Summary\r\n\r\nAn application might need to read response.body before actually sending the response. Currently, `response.body` would utilize the #each method, which should only be used when sending (or rather, only #each should send, so `response.body` shouldn't use #each). This adds a private `#each_without_send` method for `response.body` to use.\r\n\r\nFixes #23964 \r\n\r\n### Updated Description\r\n\r\nThis pull tackles the issue assuming the need for keeping `ActionDispatch::Response#body` around for use in applications' controllers or in tests. Since calling `#body` from these places should not actually send the response, we should avoid using `#each` (a method that is part of the rack interface and is used in sending the response).\r\n\r\nThe changes here aim to achieve the following:\r\n\r\n1. Implement a version of `#each` that doesn't send.\r\n2. Make sure `response.body` calls this non-sending each instead of `#each`.\r\n3. Make sure response objects in tests behave like actual sent responses (`#sent?` should return true for responses that are observed in tests)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24028","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24028/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24028/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/24028/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/24028","id":138199473,"number":24028,"title":"Loading Interlock conflicts with explicit thread use","user":{"login":"matthewd","id":1034,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1034?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/labels/activesupport","name":"activesupport","color":"FC9300"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/labels/release%20blocker","name":"release blocker","color":"e11d21"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"matthewd","id":1034,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1034?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/milestones/47","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/milestones/5.0.0","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/milestones/47/labels","id":1467326,"number":47,"title":"5.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":16,"closed_issues":393,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-18T21:17:59Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T08:14:21Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-03-03T14:48:57Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T19:57:47Z","closed_at":null,"body":"Existing code that spawns a new thread and then waits on its result, where that thread triggers an autoload, can cause a deadlock in the Interlock.\r\n\r\nWe have no programmatic evidence that such a pattern is safe. The fact it's survived in the real world, however, suggests the cases we care about are in fact safe-in-practice. Generally, they're safe because the original thread is waiting for the entire time the second thread is running -- so the \"only one thread can autoload\" rule is still actually enforced.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are two variants of this situation.\r\n\r\nThe first is where the spawned thread is just doing arbitrary work. We can detect this when it tries to autoload and notices it doesn't hold the share lock. As it's detectable, we can raise a descriptive error, and/or offer a `:trust_me` concurrency mode which allows it (again, on the basis that while we can't prove it's safe, if the code already existed [pre-interlock, it was just as unsafe.. we just weren't noticing] and was not causing weird bugs, there's a reasonable chance it's okay).\r\n\r\nThe second is where the spawned thread enters the executor. Specifically, this can come up if the spawned thread is processing requests through the application's rack middleware stack -- Capybara does this. In this case, because the callee is properly using the new APIs, I can see no way to detect that something's amiss.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn both cases, it's really the calling thread that's at fault: an autoload-capable thread cannot wait on another autoload-capable thread without yielding the lock.
